The scripts have limitations:
- [ ] UNSAFE options shouldn't be shown - e.g. wipe system-integration (has downstream check, but still dangerous)
- [ ] can't include parameters, only uses fzf wizard style. Should support both
- [ ] specific vs general versions of commands not structured well
- [ ] I don't think the "shared" hierarchy is worth it
